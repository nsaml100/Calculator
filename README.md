PWA site for my INF 654 class.

The site should open to an about page that tells the user what the pwa is with the nav bar up top.
by clicking on calculator they should be lead to the actual calculator that preforms operations for the user.
the site caches information locally and should be able to run offline after first visit.

This is my first time creating a PWA so if there are any issues let me know, but as far as I can tell it seems to work perfectly!

Thanks,
Nate
